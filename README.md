[![Open Source](https://img.shields.io/badge/Open%20Source-Yes-brightgreen)](README.md)

A professional, secure, open-source web application for running timed online quizzes and assessments. Designed for teachers and schools who want a fair, low-friction testing experience with strong anti-cheat features and stratified question pools.

No student accounts required. Students enter via a short code + basic details.

**Status:** Production-ready open source core.  
**Pro version & freelance support available** — see below.

## Key Features

- **Manual question creation only** — clean manual forms for MCQ and True/False (Excel import removed for simplicity and reliability).
- **Stratified question groups** — define groups (Easy/Medium/Hard or topic sections) with `pick_count`. Each student gets a randomized balanced subset.
- **Multiple timer modes** — Quiz timer, per-question timer, or both.
- **Server-side time authority** + auto-submit on expiry.
- **Powerful anti-cheat** — tab-switch / blur / copy / paste / right-click logging + visible suspicion counts for teachers.
- **Live monitoring** — real-time view of active students (progress, time left, suspicion).
- **Results & CSV export** — detailed per-student results with answer breakdown for auto-submitted sessions.
- **Choice & question order randomization** per student.
- **No student login friction** — just name + reg # + email. Duplicate attempt prevention via unique (quiz + reg#).
- Modern responsive UI powered by Tailwind CDN + Alpine.js + Lucide (no build step).

## Tech Stack

- Django 5.2
- Vanilla JS + Alpine.js (CDNs)
- SQLite (dev) / MySQL/Postgres (prod)
- Minimal dependencies

## Quick Start (Development)

> **Pro Tip:** Use Docker for the fastest professional setup:
> ```bash
> docker compose up --build
> ```

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/oqa-sys.git
cd oqa-sys

python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

pip install -r requirements.txt

cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env: set a strong SECRET_KEY, DEBUG=True

python manage.py migrate
python manage.py createsuperuser   # or register via web

python manage.py runserver
```

Visit http://127.0.0.1:8000/

- Student flow: enter quiz code on landing
- Teacher: `/accounts/register/` then login → dashboard

## Production / Self-Host Notes

1. Set `DEBUG=False`
2. Strong `SECRET_KEY`
3. Set `ALLOWED_HOSTS`
4. Use a real DB (Postgres recommended)
5. Collect static: `python manage.py collectstatic`
6. Run behind gunicorn + nginx (sample config in `nginx/`)
7. Configure proper email backend if extending notifications

See docs/ for more.

## Making a Quiz (Teacher Flow)

1. Create quiz → set title, duration (minutes), pass %, timer mode, randomization options.
2. Create Question Groups (optional but recommended for fairness):
   - e.g. "Easy" pick 6 of 12, 1 mark each
   - "Medium" pick 3 of 8, 3 marks each
3. Add questions manually under each group (or ungrouped).
4. Activate the quiz.
5. Share the `QZ-XXXXXX` code or direct link.

## Student Experience

- Clean focused UI
- Auto-save answers
- Navigator + progress
- Timer always synced to server
- Anti-cheat events are logged (teachers review later)
- Score shown immediately on submit. Detailed correctness only shown on timer auto-submit.

## Important Design Decisions

- **Manual entry only** — removed bulk Excel to keep deployment simple and remove external dependency surface.
- **Groups drive selection** — if you define groups with `pick_count`, students receive different questions while preserving difficulty balance.
- CSRF is enforced on AJAX APIs.
- Time calculations are server authoritative.

## Roadmap / Ideas for Contributors

- Optional written-answer / calculation question type (future Pro + OSS candidate)
- Better analytics dashboard
- Optional email notifications on quiz completion
- Docker + one-click deploy scripts
- Multi-language

## Security & Fairness

See docs/SYSTEM_DOCUMENTATION.md (sections on cheating mitigations).

This system raises the cost of casual cheating. Determined remote cheating (phones etc.) still requires human invigilation.
